# Philip Kamau - GitHub Pages Portfolio (vA2-PMK)

This package is ready to upload to GitHub Pages.

## Files
- index.html — main page
- assets/style.css — theme + print styles
- assets/charts.js — lightweight charts (no external deps)
- assets/bg_circuit.svg — subtle background overlay
- assets/favicon.svg — glowing PMK icon

## Deploy
1. Create a new GitHub repo and push the contents of this folder to the repository root.
2. In GitHub repo: Settings → Pages → Choose `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder → Save.
3. Your site will be available at https://<username>.github.io/<repo> after a few minutes.

## Notes
- The portfolio is self-contained and uses a lightweight canvas donut for charts.
- To enable richer Chart.js features, replace `assets/charts.js` with Chart.js usage.
